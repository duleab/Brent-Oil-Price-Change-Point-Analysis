# Brent Oil Price Change Point Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of Brent crude oil price data to identify structural breaks and change points using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical Brent crude oil prices to detect significant change points that correspond to major market events. Using advanced statistical methods and Bayesian inference, we identify structural breaks in the time series data and correlate them with historical market events.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis on Brent oil price data
- Implement change point detection algorithms
- Correlate detected change points with major market events
- Develop insights into oil market volatility patterns
